# Update 1
## Week 1
We spent the first week leraning about our research interest ([bees](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bee)) and exploring the [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/about) dataset. Our data come from literature reports, human observations, and natural history specimen. 
Goal of GloBI is to structure data into a usable form (csv,, tsv.). \

During our weekly meeting with the sponsors, we gained substantial knowledge about bees, especially the vital role it plays in global biotic interactions. In particular, we want to focus our research on the interactions between bees and plants. Interactions are directional, i.e. "Apis Mellifera pollinates brasicca rapa" will be categorized into source, interaction, and target, respectively.\
The goal for this week is to get a sense of the strengths and liminations of differnt query methods. Our options are direct access to the data files, [rglobi](https://github.com/ropensci/rglobi) package, [GloBI Web API](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/wiki/API), and [Cypher](https://neo4j.globalbioticinteractions.org/browser/) on [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/). We discovered that these methods operate on the same dataset, which renders the same result regardless which one we use.
