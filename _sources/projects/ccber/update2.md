# Week 5
This week we focused on cleaning the data into something we can collaboratively work with together. Instead of all of us having our own code for cleaning the data, we want to have a script that is used to clean data periodically so that we can work on the same exported data. The origianl file contains all recorded biotic interactions, and we want to create a file with only bees <-> plants interactions. 
In order to spot all entries with bees, we filter the animal family with the seven ([bee families](https://www.beelab.umn.edu/bees/bee-diversity)): Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Melittidae, and Stenotritidae. The criterion for plants is simply TaxonKingdomName == "Plantae". The interactions would be either bees as source and plants as target, or plants as source and bees as target, which we predict would have less entries. Other specific requirements include case insensitivity and removing duplicate entries.
