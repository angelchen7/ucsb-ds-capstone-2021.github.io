# ESA Annual Meeting
Our research team will attend the 2021 annual meeting of [the Ecological Society of America](https://www.esa.org/longbeach/). At the meeting, we will be presenting our work with a poster.  \

We have worked on an abstract to introduce the methods and goals of this project. Following is our tentative abstract:\
With the field of big data influencing a wide range of sectors such as government, healthcare, IoT, and more, big data is rapidly growing, and its capability is vast. Recently, large biological interaction datasets have become increasingly prevalent due to greater data collection and storage. Since pollination is an essential process for ecosystem health and food production, we find value in measuring biodiversity in pollinator bees at the family, genus, and species taxonomic levels. Through our analysis, we can develop an interpretation of the specialist versus the generalist. However, we come to find that there exist several sources of bias within the data. By recognizing that the specialist versus generalist definition is not clearly defined, we can work with programming software (Python & R) to clean, visualize, and statistically test our data in order to cultivate a more complex understanding of our motivation. Ultimately, we will construct a machine learning model to differentiate between a specialist and a generalist. Our work and results underscore the gravity of biodiversity measurement on a global scale and will contribute to downstream research within adjacent areas of study. 

# [Reference Data](https://jarrodfowler.com/specialist_bees.html)
Last quarter we have attemped to create our own criteria for generalist/specialist identification in [globi](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/data) data. Starting this quarter, we have been working on comparing globi data with a set of reference data provided by Jarrod Fowler. The reference data consists of three tables, each containing a list of specialist bees in one geological region in America (east, central, and west). In addition, the Fowler dataset includes information about the rarity of each bee species.

## Difficulties

## Compare speciliasts defined by globi and Fowler

## Using Fowler specialists as training data for globi
