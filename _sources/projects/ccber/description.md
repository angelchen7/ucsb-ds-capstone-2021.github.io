The [Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER)](https://www.ccber.ucsb.edu/) is working with our capstone team in order to explore the [Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/about) dataset. This dataset contains species interaction data and in particular, we are interested in answering questions and making inferences on bee to plant interactions.

Our sponsors are Katja Seltmann and Michelle Lee from CCBER. 

The capstone team consists of Nick Bachelder, Zoe Fang, Mitchell Rapaport, Samantha Solomon, and Angel Chen. Our faculty mentors are Professor Kate Kharitonova and Joshua Bang.
